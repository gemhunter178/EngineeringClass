The contents of this repository, unless noted otherwise, were created by me for classes in the university I went to.
As such, I request any information here to be used as reference and as a showcase of some code I have made before for class.
I ask that no one should directly copy this code for class sumbissions, though you are free to reference this code for help.

NOTE: This repo was made with no intent to break school policies and is in no way monetized.
Commits before 2021-07-01 were removed for privacy reasons.
